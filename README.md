I have a small bank and need to use items often, after realizing that the amount in % payed to the GE was massive.

My bank is breaking and thus the reason for such a plugin with inspirations from PoE.

A Runelite plugin that enhances OSRS trading capabilities with:

- **Enhanced Privacy**
    - No username storage on servers
    - Secure PGP key generation for each runelite instance
    - Anonymous listing creation with randomized identifiers

- **Server Security**
    - IP-based rate limiting
    - Abuse prevention system
    - DDoS protection measures

- **Trading Enhancements**
    - Bypass Grand Exchange trade restrictions
    - Bypass standard price boundaries
    - Eliminate transaction fees
    - Support for high-volume trades

- **Seamless Integration**
    - Native Runelite plugin
    - User-friendly interface
    - Minimal setup required

## Step-by-Step Instructions

## Additional Notes
- **Completed Orders**: Once a trade is finalized, the order is removed from listings and active orders.
- Ensure you verify all trade details before completing to avoid errors.

## ToDo's
- Add easy support for price input (1m, 1.1b etc.)
- Show other player's world when the trades have been accepted by both parties
- Ability to create orders swapping items instead of gold like: 5 lobsters for 1 shark ea
